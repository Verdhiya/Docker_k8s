# Kubernetes Hands-On Learning

## Learning Journey Overview

### Project Sequence

**1:** Minikube Setup (Single-node learning environment)  
**2:** 3-Node Cluster Installation (Production-like setup)  
**3:** Node Draining (Maintenance procedures)  
**4:** Cluster Upgrade (v1.31.13 → v1.34.1)  
**5:** RBAC User Authentication (Certificate-based auth)  
**6:** RBAC ServiceAccounts (Pod-level permissions)  

### Technologies Used

- Kubernetes v1.31.13 - v1.34.1
- kubeadm (cluster management)
- containerd (container runtime)
- Calico v3.28.0 (CNI)
- Ubuntu 24.04
- AWS EC2 (t2.medium)

### Skills Acquired

✅ Cluster installation and configuration  
✅ Multi-version upgrades (3 phases)  
✅ RBAC security implementation  
✅ Node operations and maintenance  
✅ Zero-downtime procedures  
✅ Production-grade best practices  

### Key Achievements

- Installed 3-node production-grade cluster from scratch
- Performed 3-phase upgrade across major versions
- Implemented enterprise RBAC for users and applications
- Managed node maintenance with zero downtime
- Configured automated cluster startup and data persistence
